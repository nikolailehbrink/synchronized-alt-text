# Synchronized Alt Text Plugin for WordPress Gutenberg Editor

## Problem

In WordPress, when an image is added to a post or page using the Gutenberg Editor, the alt text that was set in the Media Library might not be automatically synchronized with the alt text in the editor. This can lead to a mismatch between the alt text stored in the Media Library and the alt text displayed on the published page.

## Solution

This plugin solves the issue by synchronizing the alt text between the Media Library and the Gutenberg Editor. It does this by automatically updating the alt text in the editor for images with empty alt text.

## Features

- Automatically synchronizes empty alt text from the Media Library to the Gutenberg Editor.

## Installation

1. Download 'synchronized-alt-text' as a zip from this repository.
2. Upload the 'synchronized-alt-text.zip' file to your WordPress installation.
3. Activate the plugin in your WordPress dashboard by navigating to the Plugins menu and clicking on "Activate" for the "Synchronized Alt Text" plugin.

## Usage

1. Edit a site or a post in the Gutenberg Editor.
2. If the image has an empty alt text, the plugin will automatically synchronize it with the alt text from the Media Library.
